    This unusual Swift feature takes standard math and logical operators for instance, +,-,*,/, etc. and <,>, ==, etc. and associates them with objects.

And, according to the text, "...comes in very handy for sorting," as we shall see demonstrated in this code.
 
 Above, is a function outside the class named < (less than). That's right a function with a symbol as a name.

    Note: it uses the similar code as the in the previous closure.
 
 Its overloading process is the same as you may have seen before in standard overloading used in working logic (if/else etc.). In this case, it determines a true if the first one should come before the second, and a false the other way around. There fore, sorting our search results. The book states, "using the < operator makes it very clear that youâ€™re sorting the items from the array in ascending order," as shown in the following example:
 
 searchResultA.name = "Waltz for Debby"
 searchResultB.name = "Autumn Leaves"
 searchResultA < searchResultB  // false
 searchResultB < searchResultA  // true
